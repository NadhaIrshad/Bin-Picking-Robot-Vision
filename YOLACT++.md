YOLACT++ is an enhanced version of the original YOLACT model, developed for real-time instance segmentation. It balances speed and accuracy by decoupling mask generation from instance classification and bounding box regression, a design that significantly boosts speed on GPU-accelerated systems with CUDA.

It uses a backbone network (typically ResNet-50 or ResNet-101) for feature extraction, and a prototype network generates a set of universal mask prototypes for the entire image.
YOLACT++  generates masks in parallel with detection, unlike traditional two-stage approaches (e.g., Mask R-CNN), which makes it exceptionally fast on GPU.
Despite its real-time performance on GPU, YOLACT++ has critical limitations when used in a CPU-only setting, especially in resource-constrained environments like bin picking robots:
1.Heavy Backbone Networks: Uses deep ResNet backbones (ResNet-50 or ResNet-101) with large convolutional layers, increasing FLOPs (floating point operations).
2.Prototype Generation + Mask Coefficient Multiplication Overhead
3.Lack of Official Lightweight Versions: Attempts to modify YOLACT++ with a lightweight backbone may lead to instability or accuracy drops.
4.High Memory Usage
